    "book_title": "Stephen Hawking: A Brief History of Brilliance",
    "book_subtitle": "From Oxford to the Stars",
    "page01_title": "Curious Child in Oxford",
    "page01_text": "On January 8, 1942, in the midst of World War II, Stephen William Hawking was born in Oxford, England. His parents, both Oxford graduates, instilled in him a love of learning from an early age. Young Stephen was fascinated by how things worked, earning the nickname 'Einstein' among his classmates. He built model airplanes, took apart clocks, and spent countless nights gazing at the stars, wondering about the mysteries of the universe.",
    "page02_title": "Academic Excellence",
    "page02_text": "In 1959, Stephen entered Oxford University to study physics. Though he sometimes found the coursework unchallenging, his natural brilliance shone through, and he graduated with first-class honors in 1962. He then moved to Cambridge University to pursue a PhD in cosmology. It was here that his fascination with the universe's deepest questions truly took flight, setting him on a path that would revolutionize our understanding of space and time.",
    "page03_title": "Diagnosis and Determination",
    "page03_text": "At age 21, Stephen received devastating news: he had ALS, a progressive motor neuron disease. Doctors gave him just two years to live. Initially crushed, he soon found renewed purpose. He met Jane Wilde, who would become his first wife and greatest supporter. Rather than surrender to despair, Stephen chose to pursue his research with even greater intensity. This diagnosis, meant to end his story, instead became the beginning of his greatest chapters.",
    "page04_title": "The Black Hole Breakthrough",
    "page04_text": "In 1974, Stephen made a discovery that would cement his place in scientific history. He proved that black holes aren't completely black—they emit radiation, now known as 'Hawking Radiation.' This groundbreaking work merged quantum mechanics with Einstein's general relativity, two theories previously thought incompatible. His discovery challenged everything scientists believed about black holes and established him as one of the world's leading theoretical physicists.",
    "page05_title": "A Brief History of Time",
    "page05_text": "In 1988, Stephen published 'A Brief History of Time,' a book that would transform science communication forever. Written for general readers, it explained complex concepts like the Big Bang, black holes, and the nature of time in accessible language. The book became an international phenomenon, selling over 10 million copies worldwide. Stephen had achieved something remarkable: making the universe's deepest mysteries understandable to everyone.",
    "page06_title": "Contributions to Cosmology",
    "page06_text": "Throughout his career, Stephen made profound contributions to our understanding of the universe. Working with Roger Penrose, he developed singularity theorems about the Big Bang. He explored the nature of time, space, and the universe's origins. His work on quantum cosmology opened new frontiers in theoretical physics. Awards and honors poured in from around the world, recognizing his transformative impact on science.",
    "page07_title": "Pop Culture Icon",
    "page07_text": "Stephen's influence extended far beyond academic journals. He appeared on 'The Simpsons,' 'Star Trek: The Next Generation,' and 'The Big Bang Theory,' using humor and popular culture to engage millions. His computerized voice became instantly recognizable worldwide. Through these appearances, he showed that disability doesn't limit one's impact or ability to connect with people. He became not just a scientist, but a global cultural icon.",
    "page08_title": "Science Advocate and Voice",
    "page08_text": "Stephen used his platform to advocate for causes he believed in. He championed space exploration, arguing that humanity's long-term survival depends on becoming a multi-planetary species. He warned about climate change and the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. He supported disability rights and accessibility initiatives. His voice—both literal and metaphorical—became a powerful force for science education and human progress.",
    "page09_title": "Big Questions About the Universe",
    "page09_text": "Stephen never stopped asking the biggest questions: Why does the universe exist? Is time travel possible? What happened before the Big Bang? Can science explain everything, or is there room for something more? His willingness to explore these profound questions, even when they challenged conventional thinking, inspired new generations of physicists to think boldly and question everything.",
    "page10_title": "Eternal Legacy",
    "page10_text": "On March 14, 2018—Einstein's birthday and Pi Day—Stephen Hawking passed away at age 76, having lived 55 years beyond his initial prognosis. His legacy is immeasurable: groundbreaking scientific discoveries, millions inspired to pursue science, and proof that the human mind knows no physical boundaries. He showed us that curiosity, courage, and intellect can overcome any obstacle. His work continues to shape cosmology, and his spirit continues to inspire dreamers and thinkers everywhere.",
